# ``CurvePack``

A collection of objects to build curves in three dimensions.

## Overview

LineSeg, Arc, Quadratic, and Cubic can be drawn. Point3D, Vector3D, Line, Plane, CoordinateSystem, Transform, and OrthoVol are construction tools.

The usual measure of an angle is in radians.

The code makes no assumptions about the length units used. It is up to the adopter to be consistent.
