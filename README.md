# CurvePack

This is a project - not a product. It consists of routines used in making models for 3D printing combined as a Swift Package. InvoluteCurve has no unit testing. 

2.0.0 added trimmed curves! This commit added tests for Quadratic and Cubic.

Compile the documentation for a catalog of member functions and variables.
