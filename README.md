# CurvePack

This is a project - not a product. InvoluteCurve has no unit testing.

It consists of routines used in making models for 3D printing combined as a Swift Package. This commit added tests for Quadratic and OrthoVol.

Compile the documentation for a catalog of member functions and variables.
