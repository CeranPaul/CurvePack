# CurvePack

This is a project - not a product. InvoluteCurve and Quadratic have no unit testing.

It consists of routines used in making models for 3D printing combined as a Swift Package. This commit added Arc to reach the initial set of capabilities.

Compile the documentation for a catalog of member functions and variables.
